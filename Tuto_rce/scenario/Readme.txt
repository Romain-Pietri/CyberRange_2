Hi Redteamers,
This is a simple scenario to demonstrate how to use this CyberRange to train your red team.

The scenario is a simple web application with a vulnerabilitie. The goal is to find and exploit the vulnerabilitie to gain access to the system.

You need to have access to the /etc/passwd file 

Good luck and have fun!
